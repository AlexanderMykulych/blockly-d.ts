# blockly-d.ts
Typescript definition file generator for Google's Blockly.

This contains a d.ts file for Blockly's core folder generated by my fork [typescript-closure-tools](https://github.com/trodi/typescript-closure-tools) (My fork allows inclusion of private members, additionally, the npm package is out of date). This is intended to generate the files required for [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/). However, since it isn't currently in Definitely typed, the d.ts file is checked in for reference.

## Use Typescript definition files
* grab dist/blockly-core.d.ts (the commit will tell you which version of Blockly it was generated from)
* add above file to your typings directory
* add correct version of Blockly to your project

## Generate definition file
* git clone me
* `npm start`
* file found in dist/
