# blockly-d.ts
Typescript definition file generator for Google's Blockly.

This contains a d.ts file for Blockly's core folder generated by  [typescript-closure-tools](https://github.com/fivetran/typescript-closure-tools). This is intended to generate the files required for [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/). However, since it isn't currently in Definitely typed, the d.ts file is checked in for reference.

## Use Typescript definition files
* grab dist/blockly-core.d.ts (the commit will tell you which version of Blockly it was generated from)
* add above file to your typings directory
* add correct version of Blockly to your project

## Generate definition file
* `git clone` me
* `npm install`
    * cygwin + windows fails here, you can manually git clone the required package and compile. See previous version of this [script](npm-scripts/generate.sh) file.
* `npm start`
* file found in dist/
* copy of Blockly's dist files for this d.ts file found in dist/blockly/
