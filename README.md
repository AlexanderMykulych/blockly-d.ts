# blockly-d.ts
Typescript definition file for Google's Blockly

This contains a d.ts file for Blockly's core folder generated by my fork [typescript-closure-tools](https://github.com/trodi/typescript-closure-tools) (My fork allows inclusion of private members, additionally, the npm package is out of date). This doesn't yet meet the requirements of [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/), but that's the ultimate goal.
