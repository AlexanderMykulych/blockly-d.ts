# blockly-d.ts
Typescript definition file generator for [Google's Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).

This contains a d.ts file for Blockly's core folder generated by  [typescript-closure-tools](https://github.com/fivetran/typescript-closure-tools). This is intended to generate the files required for [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/).

## Use Typescript Definition Files
Since the definition file isn't currently in `npm`, the last generated d.ts file is checked in for reference. You should generate your own if you're using a different version of [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).
* Grab dist/blockly-core.d.ts (the commit will tell you which version of Blockly it was generated from).
  * View repo history to see d.ts files for older versions of [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).
* Add above file to your typings directory.
* Add matching version of Blockly to your project.

## Generate Definition File
* `git clone https://github.com/trodi/blockly-d.ts.git`
* `npm install`
    * cygwin + windows fails here, you can manually git clone the required package and compile. See previous version of this [script](npm-scripts/generate.sh) file.
* `npm start`
  * This will generate the definition file for the current version of [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).
* Definition file found in dist/
    * **Note:** it appears that a few mistakes must be hand fixed with recent versions of Blockly
* Copy of Blockly's dist files for this d.ts file found in dist/blockly/
